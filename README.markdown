==================


Current status
--------------

Sugar Daddies

To configure your Sugar for use with this, first add a `<meta>` section to
your Sugar's `Languages.xml`. See [this sugar's `Languages.xml`](/Languages.xml)
for more information on that.

Second, you currently have to upload your sugar to one of the following
services:
- [GitHub](http://github.com/) - *Not currently implemented*
- [Google Code](http://code.google.com/) - *Not currently implemented*
- [Coffee House](http://fileability.net/coffee) - *Not currently implemented*
