SugarManager.sugar
==================
This was originally intended to be a Sugar plug-in for the Espresso text
editor that allowed a user to browse, install, update, and uninstall other
sugars easily.

Current status
--------------
This is in a very basic format currently. It doesn't do any network access
bits (due to me doing all of the development so far on vacation without
internet), but the general interface is working.

The project is also entirely on hold (in its current non-functioning state),
due to the lead in-house Espresso developer (Jan) deciding to write his own
Sugar Manager *as a part of Espresso*. In case you couldn't tell, that's a
good thing (-:

Sugar Daddies
-------------
To configure your Sugar for use with this, first add a `<meta>` section to
your Sugar's `Languages.xml`. See [this sugar's `Languages.xml`](/Languages.xml)
for more information on that.

Second, you currently have to upload your sugar to one of the following
services:
- [GitHub](http://github.com/) - *Not currently implemented*
- [Google Code](http://code.google.com/) - *Not currently implemented*
- [Coffee House](http://fileability.net/coffee) - *Not currently implemented*
