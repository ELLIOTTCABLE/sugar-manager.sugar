      This should store the current 'version string' of the sugar. If you

      The 'status' attribute should be one of the following
       - development: Not working at all, still under active development in
          preparation for a preview version or a release
       - preview: Working, but not fully functional. Intended as a 'feature
          preview' for beta testers or interested parties
       - release: A release version, this is prepared for general use.

      be assumed.

      This should provide a URL at which the sugar should be accessed.
      
      The 'format' attribute should be one of the following:
       - raw: Only applicable with a file:// URL, this means it's an unarchived directory
       - tgz: URL references a gzipped tarfile (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
       - zip: URL references a zipfile (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
       - svn: URL references the Sugar directory's path in a SVN repository (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
       - git: URL references a publicly-accessible git upstream (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
      In all cases, the archive/repository should have the Sugar directory as
      it's root - that is, the Languages.xml file and Sugar folders (Syntaxes,
      Itemizers, etc...) should all be directly within the root of the archive/
      repository, not within a subfolder.

      This is an array of dependency elements, each of which references the

      This tag may be omitted, or left empty. Both will be assumed to mean
      that this Sugar will work without any dependencies.
      
      Since this sugar has no dependencies, see the Ruby.sugar's Languages.xml

      the working directory. No other environment is guaranteed, so be as
      explicit as possible.
      
      This is primarily intended for Cocoa sugars to compile themselves before
      installation.

      If it is not sufficient for your sugar to be copied verbatim into the
      Sugars directory as-is, such as if your sugar is compressed into a sub-
      directory or your sugar has to be compiled and then copied from a build
      folder, then you should define a relative path to your *actual* `.sugar`
      folder here.
      
      This tag may be omitted. It will default to copying this entire root
      directory into the sugars directory.
