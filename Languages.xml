      This should provide a URL at which the sugar should be accessed.
      'format' should be one of the following:
        - raw: Only applicable with a file:// URL, this means it's an unarchived directory
        - tgz: URL references a gzipped tarfile (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
        - zip: URL references a zipfile (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
        - svn: URL references the Sugar directory's path in a SVN repository (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
        - git: URL references a publicly-accessible git upstream (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
      In all cases, the archive/repository should have the Sugar directory as
      it's root - that is, the Languages.xml file and Sugar folders (Syntaxes,
      Itemizers, etc...) should all be directly within the root of the archive/
      repository, not within a subfolder.
