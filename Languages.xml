      Should probably look like 'tld.domain.Sugar.Language-name' or

      This should store the current 'version string' of the sugar. If you
      change this number, systems may prompt the user to update your sugar.
      
      The 'status' attribute should be one of the following
       - development: Not working at all, still under active development in
          preparation for a preview version or a release
       - preview: Working, but not fully functional. Intended as a 'feature
          preview' for beta testers or interested parties
       - release: A release version, this is prepared for general use.
      
      This tag may be omitted, a version of "0" and a status of "preview" will
      be assumed.

      This should provide a URL at which the sugar should be accessed.
      
      The 'format' attribute should be one of the following:
       - raw: Only applicable with a file:// URL, this means it's an unarchived directory
       - tgz: URL references a gzipped tarfile (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
       - zip: URL references a zipfile (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
       - svn: URL references the Sugar directory's path in a SVN repository (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
       - git: URL references a publicly-accessible git upstream (NOT IMPLEMENTED)
      In all cases, the archive/repository should have the Sugar directory as
      it's root - that is, the Languages.xml file and Sugar folders (Syntaxes,
      Itemizers, etc...) should all be directly within the root of the archive/
      repository, not within a subfolder.
